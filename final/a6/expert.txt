An expert system is a computer program that is designed to solve complex problems and to provide decision-making ability like a human expert. It performs this by extracting knowledge from its knowledge base using the reasoning and inference rules according to the user queries.

The expert system is a part of AI, and the first ES was developed in the year 1970, which was the first successful approach of artificial intelligence. It solves the most complex issue as an expert by extracting the knowledge stored in its knowledge base. The system helps in decision making for compsex problems using both facts and heuristics like a human expert. It is called so because it contains the expert knowledge of a specific domain and can solve any complex problem of that particular domain. These systems are designed for a specific domain, such as medicine, science, etc.

The performance of an expert system is based on the expert's knowledge stored in its knowledge base. The more knowledge stored in the KB, the more that system improves its performance. One of the common examples of an ES is a suggestion of spelling errors while typing in the Google search box.


Characteristics of Expert System

High Performance: The expert system provides high performance for solving any type of complex problem of a specific domain with high efficiency and accuracy.
Understandable: It responds in a way that can be easily understandable by the user. It can take input in human language and provides the output in the same way.
Reliable: It is much reliable for generating an efficient and accurate output.
Highly responsive: ES provides the result for any complex query within a very short period of time.

Components of Expert System
An expert system mainly consists of three components:

User Interface
Inference Engine
Knowledge Base
